# Customer behavior analysis
Data analytics project showcasing customer behavior analysis using SQL, Python and Power BI
📋 Overview

This project demonstrates end-to-end data analytics skills — from loading and cleaning raw data in Python, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), executing SQL queries, and visualizing business insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The final presentation was created using Gamma to summarize insights and recommendations.

📂 Dataset

Name: Grocery Sales Dataset (example – you can replace with your dataset name)

Source: Kaggle / Company Internal Data

Description: Contains transaction-level sales data including customer details, product categories, revenue, profit, and region information.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – Data cleaning & EDA

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server) – Querying and data manipulation

Power BI – Dashboard creation and report visualization

Gamma – Presentation and storytelling

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code – Development environment

⚙️ Steps & Process
1. Data Loading

Imported CSV dataset into Python using Pandas.

Checked dataset info, datatypes, and missing values.

2. Data Cleaning

Handled null values, duplicates, and outliers.

Converted data types and standardized column names.

Created new calculated columns (e.g., profit margin, total sales).

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed customer behavior, top products, and regional performance.

Visualized trends using bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps.

4. SQL Queries

Loaded cleaned dataset into MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server.

Wrote SQL queries for:

Top-performing products

Revenue by region

Monthly sales growth

Customer retention and return rate

5. Power BI Dashboard

Created a multi-page Power BI report with:

Performance Overview: KPIs (Total Sales, Profit, Return Rate, Revenue)

Trend Analysis: Line & bar charts for monthly/weekly trends

Map Visualization: Regional distribution of sales

Customer Insights: Demographic and behavioral segmentation

Product Insights: Category-wise profit and sales

6. Report & Presentation

Exported final insights to Power BI report.

Created a Gamma presentation summarizing:

Key findings

Business insights

Recommendations
